# YoloV4-on-Ubuntu-18.04-server
Steps for setup a YoloV4 with 2 GPUs on Ubuntu 18.04 server.

Cuda setup were pain in the neck, literally a shitshow. We were 3 “IT professional” trying to make Yolov4 works on ubuntu for one week (full time) and finally it has worked.
I want to share what we did to make it easier for you :), Becouse Nvidia did not.

#### I will gather the references of the steps in the end, and thanks for those out there sharing their knowledge and this what helped us make this machine works.

## Install Ubuntu.
- Clean up your old machine from the dust ^^.
- install ubuntu 18.04 Server with the proper confugration for the server (access to ports and on...)
-
